# Vocabulary clustered ready to use :)
This repository provides vocabulary necessary for IELTS clustered by topics which share the same context.
I appreciate any suggestions and contribution.

One topic could be placed in multiple clusters but vocabulary for each cluster is related.

The topics which are provided to date are followed below:

* [General Vocabulary](general.md)
* [Cluster one ](cluster-1.md): Obesity & Cancer & Stress
